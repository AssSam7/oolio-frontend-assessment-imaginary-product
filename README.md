---

## 🧩 Design Principles

### Domain Isolation

Business logic is separated from UI rendering.

---

### Deterministic Mock Data

Products, reviews, and details are generated using seeded randomness to maintain consistent UI.

---

### Hook-Based Data Layer

Custom hooks act as data controllers, improving testability and reusability.
